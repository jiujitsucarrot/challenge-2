# 02 Poppin' Portfolio

Welcome to this week's Challenge! This is an even-numbered week, so you won't be given any starter code. Instead, you'll create a web application from scratch! This week, you'll build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses.

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can’t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

With these points in mind, in this Challenge you’ll set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. You'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that you will use during your job search. It’s a win-win that you'll likely be grateful for in the future!

Note: If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real applications as you create them later in the course.

Let’s take a look at what a user story written from the perspective of a hiring manager might look like. As you might remember from your first Challenge, we follow the AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format.

## Objective
In this challenge the objectives are as following.
* Create a web application from scratch.
* Structure as a Professional Portfolio.
* Display core skills learned from the bootcamp. Flexbox, media queries, CSS variables, etc.
* Attach deployed projects.
* Present yourself and your work professionally.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Series of Events
In this challenge the goal was to create a web application from scratch but to style it as a professional portfolio. I was required to utilize the skills learned from the previous week. With that being said I had to develop an HTML sheet that would be connected and correspond with the correct CSS sheet. With building those I wanted to structure the content on the page utilizing a flexbox. I added media queries so that the site can be viewed across different devices. Applied linear-gradient to some of the background images. Applied headers, anchors, images, navigation, previous project link, as well as contact info. The goal was to provide a working professional portfolio. Below are attached screenshots of the application both from a standard viewing and one example on a different device screen. 

## Sources
In this challenge I utilized course lectures, notes, youtube videos, google, mdn, and past challenge HTML/CSS structures to get started on the web application.

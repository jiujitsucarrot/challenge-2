            <p>
                Thank you for stopping by to take a glimpse into my coding journey. This has been one of the more challenging skills I've decided 
                to take on over the years, but I'm always excited for the challenge. My name is Tanner Norris! I am from California but 
                reside in Arizona. I am an educator as well as an active martial artist and coach. I am currently enrolled in the Arizona State University 
                Full Stack Bootcamp, learning both front end as well as back end web development. We have covered numerous different topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
                API's (Web, Third Party, Server Side), Node.js, OOP (Object Oriented Programming), Express.js and MySQL just to name a few of what we 
                have covered so far. There is still so much more to learn, but that is half of the excitement! Whether attempting to master JavaScript 
                being the current language in front of me, or adding on new languages like Python or Ruby. Being a "forever student" I am eager to learn 
                all I can about the industry. I have attached some completed projects below, one being a group project and the others being individual 
                challenges. Please take a look, feel free to explore the content below! If you see any adjustments that can be made or better habits to practice, 
                please feel free to contact me utilizing the information listed below. Thank you again for stopping by.     
                Hope you enjoy the ride!
